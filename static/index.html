                    <h4>The pre-Tour favourites</h4>
                    <h5>William Fotheringham, Guardian &ndash; Tuesday 5th June, 12.32pm</h5>

                    <p><strong>Sheffield </strong><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/06/vincenzo-nibali-wins-stage-two-tour-de-france-2014" title="" data-link-name="in body link" class=" u-underline">The second day in Yorkshire is as much a triumph as the first</a>. Afterwards, when we scramble around the team buses, the riders repeatedly say they are in awe of the crowds and the course – although many are also relieved that the craze for selfies didn’t lead to a peloton-obliterating crash. Meanwhile, some French journalists, who are used to being provided with free regional specialities for lunch on Tour, are a little sniffy about the limited, paid-for options in the Motorpoint Arena. Still, it’s an improvement. In Leeds they had a burger van to feed them.</p>

                    <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/07/tour-de-france-2014-stage-three-report" title="" data-link-name="in body link" class=" u-underline"><strong>London</strong></a><strong> </strong>An amiable chat with the Tour director, Christian Prudhomme, who lavishes adjectives on the race’s three days in Britain and promises to be back – although he won’t commit to a specific date. Meanwhile Gary Verity, the Welcome to Yorkshire chief, says he is already preparing a dossier for Prudhomme to show how they could do it even better next time. “It will also help my successor if I’m run over by a bus,” he cheerily tells the <em>Observer</em>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Lille </strong>Thankfully, yesterday’s long delays on the Eurotunnel have eased, so the 6am journey from London, while long, isn’t too painful. We arrive in plenty of time to see <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/08/tour-de-france-2014-marcel-kittel-stage-4" title="" data-link-name="in body link" class=" u-underline">Chris Froome taken out</a> – there are gasps in the press room when it happens – and plenty believe that’s his Tour done with. Froome doesn’t speak afterwards and Sky don’t release anything about his injuries until 11pm, which makes it a long, long day. While Mark Cavendish is getting a shoulder operation, Marcel Kittel wins his third stage in four days.</p>

                    <p><strong>Ypres </strong>Before the cobbles, the Cannibal. Ypres is on lockdown for the fifth stage, and it takes an hour to get into the city, but it is worth it to hear Eddy Merckx holding court. He praises Froome – <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/09/tour-de-france-lars-boom-vincenzo-nibali" title="" data-link-name="in body link" class=" u-underline">whose fractured left wrist and right hand later forces him to withdraw</a> – but has little sympathy for those who claim the Paris-Roubaix cobbles should not be on the Tour. “Some people say they are dangerous but they are a part of cycling,” he says. “They are very special. If you want to be a complete rider you have to pass through the cobblestones.”</p>

                    <p><strong>Reims </strong><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/10/tour-de-france-andre-greipel-stage-six" title="" data-link-name="in body link" class=" u-underline">The rain that has followed the riders around France continues. It’s cold too</a>. And another crash, which takes out more than a dozen cyclists just over halfway, forces Sky’s Xabier Zandio to abandon. The Tour has had plenty of excitement so far, but one thing it has lacked since England is decent weather.</p>

                    <p><strong>Nancy </strong><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/11/matteo-trentin-peter-sagan-tour-de-france-stage-seven" title="" data-link-name="in body link" class=" u-underline">Another day, another memorial to the first world war passed by the peloton</a>. This time it’s Verdun, the longest single battle of the war. There were an estimated 700,000 casualties during the 10 months the battle was fought, and it’s appropriate that the <em>caravane publicitaire</em> – which usually dispenses loud music and cheap tat to the crowds waiting for the riders – goes quiet as a mark of respect.</p>

                    <p><strong>Gérardmer La Mauselaine </strong>After the crosswinds, rain, cobbles and the hills of Yorkshire, finally we hit the Vosges mountains. After the riders have struggled up the 1.8km climb to La Mauselaine ski station, the press room hears the familiar clanking sound of Gianni Mura’s typewriter. The Italian, who turns 70 next year, has been compared to a journalism Sinatra. Certainly, he is old school. He hates the internet. But he loves the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" class=" u-underline">Tour de France</a> and keeps coming back. The sight of an Italian in yellow only adds to his adventure.</p>
